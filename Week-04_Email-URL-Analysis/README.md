# Week 4 — Email URL Analysis 🔗

## Overview
This week I focused on analyzing URLs embedded in phishing emails. The goal was to identify how attackers disguise malicious links, extract and decode URLs safely, and perform reputation checks using multiple online tools.  
I practiced searching email bodies for hyperlinks, decoding quoted-printable text, defanging URLs, automating IOC extraction, and running threat-intelligence lookups to evaluate URL safety.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Terminal / CLI** — to view raw email content and run Python scripts  
- **Sublime Text** — for readable HTML and searching for hidden links  
- **CyberChef** — decoding quoted-printable, extracting URLs, defanging  
- **Email-IOC-Extractor (Python Script)** — automated IOC extraction  
- **PhishTank** — community-reported phishing URL checking  
- **URL2PNG** — safe visual preview of suspicious webpages  
- **URLScan.io** — sandbox and behavioral URL analysis  
- **VirusTotal** — multi-engine URL reputation scanning  
- **URLVoid** — domain blocklist and reputation checks  
- **WannaBrowser.net** — retrieve raw HTML + HTTP responses  
- **URLHaus / Unshorten.it** — investigate shortened or malicious URLs

## 📌 Additional URL Analysis Resources
- Shortened-link resolvers: **unshorten.it**, **WannaBrowser.net**  
- Malicious URL feeds: **URLHaus (abuse.ch)**  
- Domain safety checks: **Google Safe Browsing**  
- Attackers often abuse link shorteners like *bit.ly* or *tinyurl* to hide true destinations

---

## 🧾 Notes / Takeaways
- Always decode **quoted-printable** encoding to reveal true URLs.  
- **Defang** URLs before storing, sharing, or reporting them.  
- A single clean scan does **not** guarantee safety — use multiple intel sources.  
- Newly registered domains (<30 days) are major phishing red flags.  
- Inspect the **base domain** to understand attacker infrastructure (subdomains, redirects, campaign scope).  
- Even URLs from well-known services (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) can host malicious content.
